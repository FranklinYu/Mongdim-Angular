To build for production, in project root directory,

```shell
npm install
ng build --prod
```

and the files will be available in `dist` folder.

[`@angular/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli) is very helpful
both in development and production. Useful commands:

  * `ng serve`
  * `ng build`
  * `ng test`
  * `ng e2e`

and `ng help` gives more information as expected. Also each sub-command
understands `--help` flag, like `ng build --help`
